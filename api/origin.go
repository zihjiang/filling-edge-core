// Origin is Data Collector Edge origin stage. Origin stages consume data from an external system
// creating records that can be processed by processor or destination stages.
//
// Produce method - When running a pipeline, the Data Collector Edge calls this method from the Origin stage to obtain
// a batch of records for processing.
// Origin stages should not block indefinitely within this method if there is no data. They should
// have an internal timeout after which they produce an empty batch. By doing so it gives the chance to other
// stages in pipeline to know that the pipeline is still healthy but there is no data coming; and potentially
// allowing notifications to external systems.
// lastSourceOffset the offset returned by the previous call to this method, or NULL if
// this method is being called for the first time ever.
// maxBatchSize the requested maximum batch size a single call to this method should produce.
// batchMaker records created by the Source stage must be added to the
// BatchMaker for them to be available to the rest of the pipeline.
// Return the offset for the next call to this method. If NULL is returned it means the
// Source stage has fully process that data, that no more data is to be expected and that the
// pipeline should finish once the current batch is fully processed.
// Return error if the Source had an error while consuming data or creating records.
